# hello-world
My hello-world project

My name is Nathan Sampson. I am currently working as a case manager and supervisor at a non-profit that helps people with disabilities find employment. It has been rewarding work, but after 10 years and a second kid on the way, I believe it is time for a change in my career path. I originally became interested in the field after learning about Scrum and the position of Scrum Master. I felt this was a career path that could utilize my experience. However, I learned that experience in a Agile development environment will be crucial if that path is going to go anywhere. I found my way to Savvy Coders, and have now become increasingly more interested in becoming a software developer. We will see how things turn out, I guess.
